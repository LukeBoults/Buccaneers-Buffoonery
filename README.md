# Buccaneers-Buffoonery

A multiplayer pirate adventure game where each player commands their own ship, sails across an ocean map, visits islands to gather resources, and upgrades their ship with new weapons and abilities. Players can hop off their ships to explore islands on foot, collect loot, and compete (or cooperate) to become the most powerful captain on the seas.
